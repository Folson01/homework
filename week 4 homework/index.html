        <h1> This was created for homework purposes using only a little of 
        what i learned from the cohort!

    <main>
        <p>
            When i first started this course, all of this felt like a foreign language.
            But now im able to create a boiler plate website like this one! My goal is 
            to become completely proficient as a full stack web developer. Coming fro a military 
            and medical background i didn't really have much knowledge on how coding works. Other
            than whats on television; but with the help oif Savvy Coders ive come along way 
            from where i started on my coding journey. While i still have along way to go, 
            im excited for whats comes next. 
        </p>
