        Welcome to Spotted, where we help families locate their lost loved ones. We understand 
        that sometimes pets can get a little lost. Our mission is to make locating them as stress free as possible.
        Here on our website we alow users to upload information on any pets spotted around their areas as well as allowing 
        users to tell us about their loved ones. Help us get as much information as possible. Such as last areas seen and most importantly 
        tell us if your loved one is approachable or should we keep away as to not scare them off! Lastly users can upload a recent image 
        of their lost loved one! We hope were able to reunite you with your little ones and bring them home safely. So join the spotted 
        community today!
